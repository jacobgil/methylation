# Configuration file for methylation analysis
# 
# To run sweeps, you have two options:
# 1. Command line: python methylation_analysis.py --multirun group_comparison.group_a=[1],[1,3] group_comparison.group_b=[3],[2,4]
# 2. Config file: python methylation_analysis.py --config-name=sweep
#    (see conf/sweep.yaml for sweep configuration)

# Group comparison configuration
# Specify which groups to combine for comparison
group_comparison:
  group_a: [3]  # Groups to combine into group A
  group_b: [4]  # Groups to combine into group B

# Analysis parameters
# Can be swept using: python methylation_analysis.py --multirun targets=[all],[male],[female]
targets: all


# Input file paths
input:
  feature_vector_path: "feature_vector.joblib"
  groups_path: "groups.csv"
  global_set_path: "global_set.npy"

# Output configuration
output:
  folder: "output"

delta_beta_threshold: 20.0  # Minimum delta_beta value to keep
# Number of permutations for FDR calculation
# Statistical considerations:
# - The method examines the upper tail (80th-99.9th percentiles) of delta_beta distribution
# - More permutations = more stable FDR estimates, especially in the tail
# - 1000: Recommended for stable FDR estimates and publication-quality results (default)
# - 100: ~10x faster for exploratory analysis, but FDR estimates have higher variance
# - 500: Good middle ground between speed and stability
# For final results, use 1000. For quick exploration during development, 100 is acceptable.
